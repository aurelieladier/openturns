Description: dynamic libraries for OpenTURNS
 OpenTURNS is a powerful and generic tool to treat and quantify
 uncertainties in numerical simulations in design, optimization and
 control. It allows both sensitivity and reliability analysis studies:
  * define the outputs of interest and decision criteria;
  * quantify and model the source of uncertainties;
  * propagate uncertainties and/or analyse sensitivity
  * rank the sources of uncertainty
 .
 OpenTURNS is a large project with more than 300 C++ classes which
 uses well known and supported software such as R for the statistical
 methods and BLAS/LAPACK for the linear algebra.
 .
 This package provides the dynamic libraries.
 .
 The library implements almost all the treatments of uncertainty that
 OpenTURNS can provide. It is designed to be linked against any user
 specific application, or with either the textual front-end (see
 python-openturns or python3-openturns packages).
 .
 The main function of that library is giving to specific applications
 all the functionalities needed to treat uncertainties in
 studies. Targeted users are all engineers who want to introduce the
 probabilistic dimension in their so far deterministic studies.
