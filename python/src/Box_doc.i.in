%feature("docstring") OT::Box
"Box design of experiments.

Available constructor:
    Box(*levels*)

Parameters
----------
levels : sequence of int or float
    Sequence specifying the number of intermediate points on each direction
    which regularly discretize :math:`[0,1]`. In direction :math:`i`, the
    points number is :math:`levels[i]+2`: the extreme bounds 0 and 1 are
    always taken.

Notes
-----
Box is a stratified design of experiments enabling to create
a points grid by regularly discretizing the unit pavement :math:`[0,1]^n` with
the number of intermediate points specified for each direction. The number of
points generated is :math:`\prod_{i=1}^n (2+levels[i])`.

In order to scale each direction and translate the grid structure onto the
proper center, use the operator :math:`*=` and :math:`+=` of
:class:`~openturns.NumericalSample`.

Examples
--------
>>> import openturns as ot
>>> levels = [4.0, 2.0]
>>> # Here : direction 1 will be discretized with 4 intermediate points
>>> # and direction 2 with 2 intermediate points
>>> myCenteredReductedGrid = ot.Box(levels)
>>> mySample = myCenteredReductedGrid.generate()
>>> # Translate the grid
>>> mySample+=4
>>> # Scale each direction
>>> mySample*=2"
